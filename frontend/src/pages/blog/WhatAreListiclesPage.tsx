                <p>
                  A listicle is an article organized as a numbered or bulleted list. The term blends "list" and
                  "article," and the format excels at delivering information that's skimmable, comparable, and
                  immediately actionable—perfect for busy readers and for machines that parse structure.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why listicles work so well</h2>
                <ul className="space-y-2">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Scannability:</strong> Headings, numbers, and bullets let readers jump straight to what
                    matters.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Higher engagement:</strong> Clear sections encourage saves, shares, and comments.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>SEO structure:</strong> Clean H2/H3 hierarchy, consistent item blocks, and comparison tables
                    help search engines understand topical coverage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>AI-readiness:</strong> Structured "item cards," pros/cons, and "best for" tags map neatly to
                    how AI assistants assemble recommendations.
                  </li>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The AI age advantage</h2>
                <p>
                  When people ask AI assistants for "best X for Y," the systems lean on pages that are structured,
                  current, and comparative—hallmarks of listicles. Getting your brand included in relevant roundups
                  increases the odds of being surfaced (and cited) in those AI answers.
